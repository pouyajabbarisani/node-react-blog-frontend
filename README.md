# node-react-blog-frontend
NodeJs and ReactJs based blog boilerplate

See back end respository in here: [node-react-blog-backend](https://github.com/pouyajabbarisani/node-react-blog-backend)

For front-end, I'm using React (extended from **NextJs** example with apollo client for using **GraphQL**).


Run starting the project, after running npm install, just run ** npm run dev**
